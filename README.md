Hash Identifier GUI (Python)

This is a simple, standalone GUI application built with Python's tkinter library designed to help identify the type of various hash algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can input a hash string, and the tool will attempt to determine its possible algorithm(s) based on length and character patterns.

Features:

Intuitive GUI: Easy-to-use graphical interface for quick hash identification.

Broad Algorithm Support: Recognizes a wide range of common hash algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, NTLM, MySQL, Haval, RipeMD, Whirlpool, and many more).

Pattern-Based Identification: Utilizes length and character properties (alphanumeric, digit, special characters) to suggest potential hash types.

Clear Output: Displays possible hash algorithms, sorted by likelihood, or indicates if no match is found.

How to Use:

Run the Python script.

Enter the hash string into the "HASH:" input field.

Click the "Identify Hash" button.

The "Identification Results:" area will display the detected hash algorithm(s).

Example Hashes for Testing:

MD5: ae11fd697ec92c7c98de3fac23aba525

SHA-1: 4a1d4dbc1e193ec3ab2e9213876ceb8f4db72333

NTLM: cc348bace876ea440a28ddaeb9fd3550
